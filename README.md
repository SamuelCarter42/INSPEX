# INSPEX
A GUI for In-Situ electron energy spectral analysis

Intended as an in-situ equivalent to OSPEX for HXRs, this software provides a user-friendly pipeline to download, analyse and fit in-situ electron spectra.

This software was written using Anaconda, and I reccomend that distribution is used to run the software. In addition to the packages included in that ditribution, the following oackages are also required:
lmfit
solo_epd_loader
pickle
